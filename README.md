This project compares performance of binary classifiers like BernoulliNB, RandomForestClassifier, LogisticClassifier on two sets of data. Performance is measured by ROC/AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The heart disease dataset in `classify_heart.ipynb` is available via Kaggle. The income dataset in `classify_income.ipynb` is available through the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.
